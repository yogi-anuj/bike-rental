Look for reviews and ratings from previous customers. Check if they have a good safety record and if their bikes and scooters are regularly maintained. Choosing a reputable rental company will help ensure that you receive a safe and reliable vehicle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wear a helmet and other safety gear<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearing a helmet is crucial when riding a bike or scooter. It can protect your head in case of an accident and reduce the risk of serious injury or death. Many rental companies provide helmets, but it&#8217;s always best to bring your own if you have one. In addition to a helmet, consider wearing other safety gear such as knee and elbow pads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Embrace the open road, feel the wind in your hair, and let the world be your guide. Discover new horizons, create unforgettable memories, and experience life at your own pace. Ride, explore, and make every journey an extraordinary one.<\/p>\n<cite>John Doue, CEO \u201cLorenty\u201d<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Follow traffic rules and be aware of your surroundings<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When riding a bike or scooter, it&#8217;s important to obey traffic rules such as stopping at stop signs and red lights. Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye out for other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles. Always ride defensively and assume that drivers may not see you. Stay in designated bike lanes or on the side of the road when possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded-corners\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"850\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/themes.getmotopress.com\/lorenty-bike\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/61\/2023\/05\/post-cont-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-95\" srcset=\"https:\/\/themes.getmotopress.com\/lorenty-bike\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/61\/2023\/05\/post-cont-2.jpg 850w, https:\/\/themes.getmotopress.com\/lorenty-bike\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/61\/2023\/05\/post-cont-2-300x187.jpg 300w, https:\/\/themes.getmotopress.com\/lorenty-bike\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/61\/2023\/05\/post-cont-2-768x479.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, renting a bike or scooter can be a fun and convenient way to explore a new place, but safety should always come first. Choose a reputable rental company, wear a helmet and other safety gear, and follow traffic rules and be aware of your surroundings. With these tips in mind, you can enjoy a safe and enjoyable rental experience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bike and scooter rentals have become a popular mode of transportation for tourists and locals alike.
