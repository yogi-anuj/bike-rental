Locks are essential for preventing theft and keeping your rental safe when you need to leave it unattended. U-locks are a popular choice as they are sturdy and hard to break. You can also consider getting a cable lock for added security or a combination lock for ease of use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded-corners\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"850\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/themes.getmotopress.com\/lorenty-bike\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/61\/2023\/05\/post-cont-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94\" srcset=\"https:\/\/themes.getmotopress.com\/lorenty-bike\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/61\/2023\/05\/post-cont-1.jpg 850w, https:\/\/themes.getmotopress.com\/lorenty-bike\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/61\/2023\/05\/post-cont-1-300x187.jpg 300w, https:\/\/themes.getmotopress.com\/lorenty-bike\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/61\/2023\/05\/post-cont-1-768x479.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lights<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan on using your rental bike or scooter at night, you&#8217;ll need to add lights to ensure visibility and safety. Bike lights and reflectors are essential for illuminating your path and making you visible to other road users. Headlights and taillights are must-haves for riding in low-light conditions or after dark. You can also opt for LED wheel lights or reflectors to make your ride more fun and stylish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Embrace the open road, feel the wind in your hair, and let the world be your guide.

Helmets are crucial for protecting your head in case of an accident or fall. Most bike and scooter rental companies will provide helmets, but it&#8217;s always a good idea to bring your own for added comfort and hygiene. There are a variety of helmets available, from traditional bike helmets to more stylish options like the trendy urban helmets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded-corners\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"850\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/themes.getmotopress.com\/lorenty-bike\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/61\/2023\/05\/post-cont-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-95\" srcset=\"https:\/\/themes.getmotopress.com\/lorenty-bike\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/61\/2023\/05\/post-cont-2.jpg 850w, https:\/\/themes.getmotopress.com\/lorenty-bike\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/61\/2023\/05\/post-cont-2-300x187.jpg 300w, https:\/\/themes.getmotopress.com\/lorenty-bike\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/61\/2023\/05\/post-cont-2-768x479.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding locks, lights, and helmets to your bike or scooter rental will enhance your riding experience and ensure your safety. With these essential accessories, you can ride with confidence, knowing that your rental is secure, visible, and you are protected in case of an accident.
